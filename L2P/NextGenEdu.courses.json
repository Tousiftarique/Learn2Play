This course is fun, and when you need some energy to keep going, you will get it from me.</p><p><strong>My Approach</strong></p><p>Practice, practice and more practice. Every section inside this course has a practice lecture at the end, reinforcing everything with went over in the lectures. I also created a small application the you will be able to download to help you practice PHP. To top it off, we will build and awesome CMS like WordPress, Joomla or Drupal.</p><p><br></p>",
